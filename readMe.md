# Zuri Task - Week 4
## CSS Fundamentals - Cont'd

Zuri week 4 task is to consolidate our understanding of
CSS Layouts by using different layout methods such as flex 
and grid to position content around the webpage and also make
them responsive.

Responsiveness is all about making a webpage or website
look good on all screens from mobile, to tablet, to desktop,
to laptop, etc.


Two tasks were given :

A) Recreate a 3-column card design using CSS Flexbox Layout
- This task should be on the index.html file.
